# Exercise 1: Evaluate and Compare
# Write a program to:

# Take two numbers as input from the user.
# Perform the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
# Check if the first number is greater than the second and print the result using a logical operator.
# Check if at least one of the numbers is even.

# Example Input:
# Enter first number: 12
# Enter second number: 5

# Expected Output:
# Addition: 17  
# Subtraction: 7  
# Multiplication: 60  
# Division: 2.4  
# Modulus: 2  
# Is the first number greater than the second? True  
# Is at least one number even? True  

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2: Logical Operations Challenge
# Given three inputs 
# 𝑥,z,𝑦 
# Check and print if all three numbers are greater than 10.
# Check and print if at least one number is less than 5.
# Print the logical negation of  𝑥 > 20

# Example Input:
# Enter x, y, z: 15 12 8

# Expected Output:
# All numbers are greater than 10: False  
# At least one number is less than 5: False  
# Logical NOT (not x > 20): True

# Exercise 3: Grade Checker
# Write a program to take a percentage score from the user and determine the grade:

# A: 90 and above
# B: 80 to 89
# C: 70 to 79
# D: 60 to 69
# F: Below 60

# Example Input:
# Enter your score: 85

# Expected Output:
# Grade: B

# Exercise 4: Simple Calculator
# Take two numbers and an operator as input and perform the respective operation. Include an option to calculate the floor division (//). If the operator is invalid, print an error message.

# Example Input:
# Enter operator and two numbers  : // 10 3 

# Expected Output: 
# Result: 3
